# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:April 07, 2019 
##### (Preapared to join the 100 days of code)

**Today's Progress**: worked on frontend material of the Code Institute and preparing to koin the 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Main focus is to master the basics of JS.

### Day 1:April 08, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: worked on a simple project.

**Thoughts:** Although I have a small knowledge of the basic points of JS, there are many things to master yet. Such as methods and proper creates a function. These are few things which I have spotted, however, there are an ocean to learn during this 100 days.

### Day 2:April 09, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: worked on a simple project.

**Thoughts:** there are many things that I still needing to learn. However, every tutorial that I am learning combined with the Code Institute lessons approaches me towards a better understanding of JS. Therefore, today I began a simple game project (tetris) in which helped me to better understand functions, variables and a little of how to structure code. I whish one day be able to emulate the code inside my head as driving a car or cycling. 

### Day 3:April 10, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: begin of Jquery.

Today I finished the small project with vanilla #JS  then jumped straight to #jQuery with @CodersInstitute. It is much easier to understand something when you are all in. However, I just need a bit of momentum to stop pushing and be part of the flow.
