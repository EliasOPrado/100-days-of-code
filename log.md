# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:April 07, 2019 
##### (Preapared to join the 100 days of code)

**Today's Progress**: worked on frontend material of the Code Institute and preparing to koin the 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Main focus is to master the basics of JS.

### Day 1:April 08, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: worked on a simple project.

**Thoughts:** Although I have a small knowledge of the basic points of JS, there are many things to master yet. Such as methods and proper creates a function. These are few things which I have spotted, however, there are an ocean to learn during this 100 days.

### Day 2:April 09, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: worked on a simple project.

**Thoughts:** there are many things that I still needing to learn. However, every tutorial that I am learning combined with the Code Institute lessons approaches me towards a better understanding of JS. Therefore, today I began a simple game project (tetris) in which helped me to better understand functions, variables and a little of how to structure code. I whish one day be able to emulate the code inside my head as driving a car or cycling. 

### Day 3:April 10, 2019 
##### (Followed a simple tutorial)

**Today's Progress**: begin of jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the small project with vanilla #JS  then jumped straight to #jQuery with @CodersInstitute. It is much easier to understand something when you are all in. However, I just need a bit of momentum to stop pushing and be part of the flow.

### Day 4:April 11, 2019 
##### (jQuery selectors to events)

**Today's Progress**: jQuery.

**Thoughts:** After finished the #JS #jquery selector part, today I began the jquery events. So far lessons are easier. I have to say that, those small projects with vanilla #javascript are helping loads. There are many small things that I should give attention after I finish this part such as SASS and Jasmine tesing.

### Day 5:April 12, 2019 
##### (jQuery events)

**Today's Progress**: jQuery.

**Thoughts:** #javascript #jQuery events are awesome and great to work with for newbies like me haha. The purpose of the study today was simple to make some animations using different jQuery functions such as .show(), .hide(), .toggle() and many others.
